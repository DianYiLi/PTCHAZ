# Post-Tropical Cyclone HAZard model (PTCHAZ)

The Post-Tropical Cyclone HAZard model (PTCHAZ) is a statistical model for assessing post-tropical cyclone hazard. The model uses the synthetic TC track and intensity generated by an existing TC hazard model (e.g., CHAZ: https://github.com/cl3225/CHAZ) as a starting point. The model consists of three components that represent the complete PTC life cycle. These components include a logistic regression model for extratropical transition (ET) timing, an auto-regressive (AR) model for predicting PTC intensity, and a probability-based model for PTC dissipation.

The PTCHAZ model is developed using MATLAB and Python 3. The model can be run as follows:

## 1. Prepare data for model training and prediction
   
   preprocess_logistic_v1.m: prepare data used in training the ET timing model
   
   preprocess_AR_v1.m: prepare data used in training the intensity model
   
   CHAZ_PTC_track4pre_v11.m: prepare synthetic track for next preprocessing step
   
   CHAZ_PTC_preprocess_v11_1.m: prepare environmental factors for running the model
   
## 2. Train the model
 
   logistic_regression.ipynb: train ET timing model
   
   CHAZ_stepwise_v11.m: train intensity model, the 3- and 8-predictor configurations can be selected here.
   
   CHAZ_obs_dissp_v1.m: train dissipation model
   
## 3. Predict ET timing
 
   CHAZ_ET_v1.m
   
## 4. Predict PTC intensity and dissipation.
