# PTCHAZ

The Post-Tropical Cyclone HAZard model (PTCHAZ) is a statistical model for estimating tropical cyclone hazard. The model uses the synthetic TC track and intensity generated by an existing TC hazard model (i.e., CHAZ: https://github.com/cl3225/CHAZ) as a starting point. The model consists of three components that represent the complete PTC life cycle. These components include: a logistic regression model for extratropical transition (ET) timing, an auto-regressive (AR) model for PTC intensity prediction, and a probability-based PTC dissipation model.

The PTCHAZ is developed using Matlab and Python3.

1. Prepare storm-related and environmental factors

2. Model training

3. Predict ET timing

4. Predict PTC intensity and dissipation.
